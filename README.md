# gabibbo97 Helm chart

Hello, these are charts that I find useful in my day to day business.

Many of these charts are opinionated around the concept of cloud-nativeness instead of simply packaging an application and deploying it, we should be leveraging immutable,  declarative, auditable configuration from day1.

I do not care very much about `Chart.yaml` `version`, so look carefully at the history before upgrading.

The repo is actually a misomer because there are many k8s related utilities that are related to this repo.
